# Official MongoDB image as the base image
FROM mongo

# ATTENTION: The build context is specified in deployMongoCustom.yml workflow file on github which is /backend/mongoDB. 
# This is why the Copy command below use directly mongod.conf. read more about it on https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo
# Right now this is not needed. A better approach is to copy the mongod.conf file from the repo into the server, and 
# Start the container with the --config flag pointing to the host machine conf file.

# Copy the custom configuration file to the container
COPY mongod.conf /etc/mongod.conf
