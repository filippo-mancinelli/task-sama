- if i create an NFT not from the website but via raw SC, the DB is not updated with the like mapping which causes the breaking of the homepage view.
- disconnect button not working (setup cookie system)
- test the transaction.wait() receipt with payable functions
- remove winner address from task Struct on SC since the task is deleted after the winner is chosen
- change data structure also for taskSama contract NFTs
- videos tokenId stars from 1 (wrong?)
- Task and Tasksama using different data structure for NFTs (array vs mapping)

x fix truffle mess
x fix spinning on participate in case of rejected transaction
x add spinning animation
x when disconnecting the status of wallet does not change
x show success modal only when transaction confirmed.
